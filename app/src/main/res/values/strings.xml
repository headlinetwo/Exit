    <string name="game_description_text">Exit is a very minimalistic yet challenging two-dimensional strategy game!\nYour goal is it to maneuver every snake into one goal by swiping either UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nHave fun!</string>
    <string name="about_text">Exit is a level based game with currently 100 unique levels. Each level features a different game field as well as multiple snakes that can be controlled by the player. It is your objective to manoeuvre every snake into one goal by only using swipes.\nA swipe is a simple gesture that can be performed by swiping across the screen from left to right, top to bottom, right to left or bottom to top. But beware you may only control all snakes collectively. This means if you swipe up, all snakes that have an empty block above their head will move upwards.\n\nThe ultimate goal is it to manoeuvre every snake into one goal by using as little swipes as necessary, without getting stuck on the way there. Not getting stuck sounds pretty easy, but as you progress through different levels you will notice that often a certain swipe is going to place a snake in a dead end or tangled in itself/another snake.\n\nRating us on the Google Play Store is highly appreciated!</string>

    <string name="main_menu_landing_page_total_progress_info_text">Your progress:\nYou perfectly solved %solved% out of %total% levels.\nYou used %swipe_count% swipes to solve all your levels so far. It is possible to solve all levels with %min_swipe_count% swipes.</string>

    <string name="level_locked_info_text">Unfortunately this level is currently locked! You need to unlock all previous levels to play this level! To unlock a level you can either watch an advertisement or beat the previous levels.</string>
